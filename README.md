Hi, my name is David and I currently work as Front-end web developer at [BOOTIQ.io](https://www.bootiq.io/en).

I love working on OSS projects and helping other people with their problems in various fields.

I was studying in computer science field only shortly, so I'm learning most of the things by myself by practice. I have studied mostly in field of mechanical engineering with focus on industrial design.
